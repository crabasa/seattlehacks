<h1 class="extra">Contributing to Seattle Hacks</h1>
Seattle Hacks is a community-driven online resource by devs for devs. The goal is to highlight the best resources and events for developers in the Seattle area:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> powered website - anyone can fork this repo and submit a pull request to update the content of this website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> powered blog - submitting a post is as simple as composing a markdown file and sending a pull request.</li>
	<li>Calendar of events - if your blog post is about an upcoming event, you can simply add some meta-tags to your blog post and it will be added to an automatically generated calendar.</li>
	<li>When a post goes out, it will also be automatically tweeted by <a href="http://twitter.com/SeattleHacks">@SeattleHacks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submitting a Post</h2>

<h2>Submitting an Event</h2>
<p>Submitting an event is just like submitting a post. Follow the instructions above and you're 90% of the way there. Consider the content of the post to both be an announcement of your event and the core information that people need to know to find your event.</p>
<p>The only difference is that in order for your event to make it into our calendar you need to define some additional info. All of these variables are **required**:</p>
