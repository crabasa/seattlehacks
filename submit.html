title: Contributing to New York Hacks
---
New York Hacks is a community-driven online resource by devs for devs. The goal is to highlight the best resources and events for developers in the New York City area:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> powered website - anyone can fork this repo and submit a pull request to update the content of this website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> powered blog - submitting a post is as simple as composing a markdown file and sending a pull request.</li>
	<li>Calendar of events - if your blog post is about an upcoming event, you can simply add some meta-tags to your blog post and it will be added to an automatically generated calendar.</li>
	<li>When a post goes out, it will also be automatically tweeted by <a href="http://twitter.com/NYHacks">@NYHacks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Editing Pages</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Fork this repo and checkout the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
	<li>Edit the file you'd like to modify</li>
	<li>Submit a pull request</li>
</ol>
<p>We will review all pull requests and make sure they are on-topic and adding value to the developer community in New York.</p>
<h2>Submitting a Post</h2>
<p>Same as above, with a few extra steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Compose your post using Markdown syntax</li>
	<li>Name the file YYYY-MM-DD-title.md and copy to _posts directory</li>
	<li>Make sure the commit message is the same as the post title (i.e. <code>git commit -m "{post title}"</code>)</li>
	<li>Submit a pull request for this new file</li>	
</ol>
<p>Please make sure you include a <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter">YAML header</a> at the top of the file that defines the <code>title</code> of your post and specifies the "post" for <code>layout</code>. Please also include your Github handle for the <code>author</code>.</p>

<h2>Submitting an Event</h2>
<p>Submitting an event is just like submitting a post. Follow the instructions above and you're 90% of the way there. Consider the content of the post to both be an announcement of your event and the core information that people need to know to find your event.</p>
<p>The only difference is that in order for your event to make it into our calendar you need to define some additional info. All of these variables are **required**:</p>
