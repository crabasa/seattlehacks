[Seattle.rb](http://seattlerb.org) was the first Ruby and Rails user group in
North America and has met regularly for over a decade.

We now have a monthly social event, the first tuesday of every month, at the
Substantial offices, featuring Scheduled speakers, lightning talks, and beer.

The Ruby and Rails worlds are known for their collaboration, and Seattle.rb
takes an active role. We focus on fun and collaborate to solve problems. We
provide each other support as we take on new challenges in Ruby. We're proud to
be the home of some of the [best Ruby developers around](http://www.seattlerb.org/people).
Check out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICVdf4WidkY) about our
humble beginnings.

We encourage everyone, from Ruby novice to expert, to join us to learn and
contribute. We're excited to grow and support the Ruby and Rails communities.
