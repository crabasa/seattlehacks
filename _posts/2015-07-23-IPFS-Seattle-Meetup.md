The IPFS crowd has been working hard, from a super secret facility[1], on the Interplanetary Filesystem project, also known as IPFS (ipfs.io).

## What is IPFS

IPFS is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. If IPFS is something new to you, make sure to visit ipfs.io and watch the demo for in depth run through.

We are truly excited with what we have achieved so far and want to share that with you, invite you to take part, hack on the project, hear your questions, your ideas and with that, make it better for everyone to use it.

We’re hosting a meetup this Thursday, 23th of July at Surf Incubator Event Space, 821 2nd Avenue, Suite 410, Seattle, WA. (Note location change, no longer at Impact HUB!) The meetup will start at 7pm and there will be light food and drinks.

There is no knowledge requirement to join this meetup, it is open to all the people that care about future of the Web and its underlying foundations that enable the platforms and societies that we want to build.

Also, you are welcome to join us on the IRC channel on We’ve updated the Venue for this event. It will be at the Surf Incubator Event Space, 821 2nd Avenue, Suite 410, Seattle, WA 98104.

[1] Actually it isn’t secret at all, we are working at Seattle Impact Hub every day during the month of July, if you want to hangout, talk about P2P, cryptocurrencies, distributed systems in general, ask questions about IPFS or even show us your project, please holler, we will be excited to hangout with you!
