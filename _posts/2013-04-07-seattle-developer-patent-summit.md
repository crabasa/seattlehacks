#SEATTLE DEVELOPER PATENT SUMMIT | #DevPatents

The software patent system poses a significant challenge for developers. Vague claims, product life cycles shorter than the PTO review process, patent trolls and general uncertainty threaten to stile app industry innovation and growth. Throughout the year, the Application Developers Alliance will host events around the country and invite developers to share stories of claim letters, lawsuits, the challenges they face, and the need for software patent reform.  

Patents summits will bring developers, policymakers and patent experts together to discuss practical topics like assertion and defense strategies for startups and examine the issue of policy reform.  Each event will feature a patent expert, followed by a panel discussion between policymakers, app developers, and attorneys. The events will conclude with an open Q&A for attendees and a networking reception - including food and drinks.
