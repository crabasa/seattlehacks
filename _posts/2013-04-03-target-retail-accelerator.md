Co.Labs, the newest member of Fast Company's Co. network, has launched with an exciting contest to create a mobile shopping app—or retail accelerator—for Target. The winner will receive $75,000 and 7 finalists will be given $10,000.

This gives finalists the opportunity to work with Target’s API, marking the first time access has been granted to the public. Each finalist gets a chance to work with one of the leading innovators in the retail space and will be paired with a liaison from Target to help their app fit the Target platform. 

The aim of this competition is to bring visibility to individual coders, teams, and startups who are unknown but doing great work. The deadline for entries to the Co.Labs & Target Retail Accelerator is April 30th, 2013.
