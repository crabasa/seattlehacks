Creative Code and Coffee is a casual weekly gathering for hacking on creative code projects before heading to work, for anyone who creates art with code and enjoys coffee in the morning. Processing, OpenFrameworks, D3.js, Arduino, whatever your flavor, come share your projects, chat, have a donut, drink some coffee, and hack hack hack.

Meets every Tuesday between 7am and 9-ish (punctuality optional) at Top Pot Doughnuts on 5th Ave.
