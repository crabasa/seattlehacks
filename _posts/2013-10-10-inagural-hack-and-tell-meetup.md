*(Below words of event organizer Alex Clemmer)*

So you've been working on something cool. You want to show it to people. Great. 

* We'll give you 5 minutes to show us your hack. 
* Then we'll give you 5 minutes to answer questions. 

Me personally, I'll be presenting a LISP my friend and I wrote for the Apple //e.
Have a look at the video at the bottom of this message, or take a look at this
nifty blog post we wrote about it.

If you want to present (come on, you obviously do!), then please tell us about
your hack here: [http://bit.ly/19eHuEM](http://bit.ly/19eHuEM)

**Remember, though: no startup pitches, no deckware, and no projects that are
purely client work.**
