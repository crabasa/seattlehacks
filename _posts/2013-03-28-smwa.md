**Speaker:** Jason Carr, Mobile Engineer at Sauce Labs

**Title:** Mobile Test Automation with Selenium and Appium

The last few years have seen Selenium become a de facto open
source standard for testing desktop and mobile websites, and the
search for a tool that allows the same flexibility with mobile
applications is well underway. Appium provides a tool that fills that
gap. This talk will cover some selenium basics (what is selenium, why
do I care?) and use that knowledge to demonstrate how you can use
selenium-like scripts to automate your mobile applications on iOS and
Android. We'll cover phone gap and titanium apps, fully native apps,
web views, and even a little mobile web automation. Finally, we'll
talk about the future of the project and do some comparison with other testing tools.

**Sponsor:** Thanks to our friends at [Filter Digital][1] for hosting us and providing the food and drink!
