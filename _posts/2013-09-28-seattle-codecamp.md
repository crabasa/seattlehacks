Seattle CodeCamp 2013
=====================

This fall the western washington development community is coming together for an outstanding community-based software conference.

What is Code Camp?
------------------

Code Camp is a community event where developers talk with, and learn from, fellow developers. All are welcome to attend and speak. Code Camps have been very successful, and we have been bringing that success to Seattle since 2005!

What can I expect at the Seattle Code Camp?
-------------------------------------------

A full day of talking about code with fellow developers. Sessions will range from informal "chalk talks" to presentations. There will be a mix of presenters, some experienced folks, for some it may be their first opportunity to speak in public. We are expecting to see people from throughout the Pacific Northwest region and beyond.

We don't yet have a list of sessions on the site as we are still collecting sessions from speakers. Interested in speaking please head [here](https://seattle.codecamp.us/sessions/add). Watch the [site](https:/seattle.codecamp.us) for more details and schedule as we firm things up.

Is this a Microsoft (or open source, Java, etc) event?
------------------------------------------------------

The answer is no (or all of the above depending on your perspective). This is a Seattle developer community event, not a Microsoft or any other company event. Everyone is welcome to present so long as it fits the Code Camp guidelines (must be about code, and isn't a direct advertisement for a product or service).

Don't think about Code Camp in terms of what technological faction it caters to... Think about it as an event where developers convene and share their knowledge and experience. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate!

How can I attend the Seattle Code Camp?
---------------------------------------

Attendance is $10 and space is limited so you need to [register](http://seattlcodecamp2013.eventbrite.com). We will send occasional updates via the email address you used when you register.
