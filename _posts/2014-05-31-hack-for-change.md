*The goal*: bring together technologists, entrepreneurs, social activists, designers, and citizens to address civic issues in Seattle.

*Anyone can participate*. You donâ€™t have to be an expert in technology, but you do have to care about your neighborhood and community.

The Seattle event is one of dozens planned around the country, and will be part hackathon, part unconference.
