HackRU is a 24-hour student hackathon. Students (like you) will work alone or in small teams to envision, create, and demo an application. At the start of the hackathon, we will have several companies present their technologies. You can use these in your applications. Throughout the day, you will be surrounded by mentors from our sponsoring companies, and fellow hackers who will help you along the way. At the end of 24 hours, we will all huddle together with a panel of judges who will award prizes for the best hacks. As a whole, HackRU will be an incredible experience for learning and creation.

HackRU is organized by the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists (USACS). What started as a small event, held in empty classrooms and scraped together by passionate hackers, has evolved into a huge inter-school event.

You have an opportunity to be a part of this amazing event and build the application you've always wanted to.
